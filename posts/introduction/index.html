<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I will be using this site to record my daily thoughts and learning. I feel that it is a good idea to organize my messy thoughts and progress into a blog. It would not only be a database of my thoughts and things I reached online (and offline) but also encourage me to express my ideas.</p><blockquote><p>Reading makes a full man, meditation a profound man, discourse a clear man. - Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote><p>I believe there are three things that I better master to live my life:</p><ol><li>General Improvement Strategy</li><li>Philosophical Foundations of the World</li><li>Technical Skills for my career</li></ol><p><em>The blog will be mainly in English and sometimes in Chinese for more in-depth analysis.</em></p><h1 id=general-improvement-strategy>General Improvement Strategy
<a class=heading-link href=#general-improvement-strategy><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>My desire to improve has always been there. But I am not improving as much I wish due to some bad habits and ways to approach stuff. There are some general guiding principles which I should learn to be more systematic and not just blindly improve. Recently reading the book <em>Atomic Habits</em>. Apart from that, there is another direction for improvements following the line of intellect augmentation. > The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated&mldr; The real powers come from devising external aids that enhance cognitive abilities. - Donald Norman For the body, focus is on cardiorespiratory function, muscle relaxation and functional movement. Aerobic exercies + calisthenics + right eating + right sleeping + right breathing = healthy body. # Philosophical Foundations of the World World means everything, physical and mental, body and mind, everything that you are living in and interacting with. It is important to understand the world as it is. You live your life in the world, everything is there. So, it is essential to study deeply what is the world presented before us. Everything is meaningless if the world they live in has no meaning. It is also brilliant to re-engineer our response to the world. Oftentimes it is not the world that makes us suffer, but our response.<br>So far, I have developed some ideas based on Buddism:</p><ol><li><strong>Our world is made up of signals coming from our five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, plus the internal world dominated by our thoughts.</strong></li><li>As there is no self in the five aggregates, there is suffering but no sufferor.</li></ol><p>The principles and discoveries of &ldquo;my&rdquo; world are still under development, mainly through meditation, <strong>the goal of which is to reach a silent and peaceful heart that is ready to discover wisdom that cannot be discovered should you indulge in five senses and thoughts</strong>. I will try to progress and record the process in this blog.</p><h1 id=technical-skills>Technical Skills
<a class=heading-link href=#technical-skills><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I aspire to be a full stack artificial intelligence developer, or system designer, ideally hybrid work mode if not remote. I feel that AI/ML is the future trend of the world, computer can greatly assist lots of work only human can do in the past. Hence, gaining the technical know-how of AI/ML and designing great system for the business or industry might be a lucrative career path.</p><p>Moreover, it requires a good foundation of maths + software engineering + business sense + problem solving + communication + computer architecture knowledge + system design + etc., which are hard to master. Everyone who aspires to enter the field must pass a certain threshould of hard work and intelligence.</p><p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s a really fair system, much fairer than those that uses school + license system to control the supply of a workforce. License system is a valid system but just make sure everyone has equal chance anytime to learn and fight for the license based on their knowledge, passion and skills closely related to that field but not something else.</p><p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn related knowledge skills in advance and hopefully when the skills are in demand, I am the rare ones who can supply.</p><p>There will be three main technical skills that I want to master:</p><ul><li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li><li>Machine Learning</li><li>System Design</li></ul><p>Moreover, 1) I shall focus on <strong>visualization</strong> of algorithms, data and programming in general. As I come to believe that you can&rsquo;t fully understand a thing without seeing it. Bret victor is a great inspiror on this topic. 2) <strong>Designing</strong> a fully functional system is much more interesting than focusing on specific programming tasks.</p><h1 id=personal-interest>Personal Interest
<a class=heading-link href=#personal-interest><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I will also share some of my interests and hobbies, if have time. They are mainly football, calisthenics, physics (time and space), anime, cats, and ml.</p></div><footer></footer></article><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script>
