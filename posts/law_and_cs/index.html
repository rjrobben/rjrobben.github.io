The experience of completing missions and minigames to increase your rank is certainly fun, but I find it even more enjoyable to explore the open world and discover hidden gems.</p><h2 id=teach-you-how-to-think-vs-the-dullness-of-law>Teach You how to Think vs the Dullness of Law
<a class=heading-link href=#teach-you-how-to-think-vs-the-dullness-of-law><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>One of the most powerful conceptual frameworks in computer science is the use of graphs, which can be used to model everything from protein structures to social networks and even the human body. Additionally, concepts such as recursion and divide and conquer are essential for developing efficient and effective solutions to complex problems.</p><p>In contrast, I have found that studying law can sometimes make me feel like I am dumber, as the subject matter can be quite specific and difficult to grasp. Furthermore, while the ability to manipulate people and navigate the hierarchy of a society can be a valuable skill to have, I am more interested in using my skills to build systems that are used by a large number of people.</p><h2 id=the-excitement-of-applied-problem-solving>The Excitement of Applied Problem Solving

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>In my part-time job, I used to spend a lot of time doing report summaries for my boss by copying and pasting information from several websites. However, with web scraping and with today&rsquo;s LLM capabilities, I realized that this task could be completely automatable.</p><h2 id=why-i-chose-computer-science-as-my-career>Why I Chose Computer Science as My Career

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>In conclusion, while a law degree can provide valuable people skills, I have found that my passions lie in the exciting world of computer science. By utilizing my skills in programming and AI, hopefully I can build systems that are used by many people and contribute to solving complex problems in our world.</p></div><footer></footer></article><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script>
