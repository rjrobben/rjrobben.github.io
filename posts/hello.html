            <h1>What Popular Apps Share in Common: Powerful Recommender Systems</h1>
            <p class="publication-info">
                <time datetime="2024-08-15T23:46:00+08:00">Published on August 15, 2024 at 11:46 PM HKT</time>
            </p>

            <p>The most popular and successful apps like Instagram, YouTube, Threads, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Spotify all
                share a common feature: a powerful recommender system. All your feeds are arranged by recommendation
                algorithms operating on large-scale datasets behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>Meta has even built a cluster of GPUs specifically for recommending personalized content to users.

            <h2>Recommendation as a Search Problem</h2>

            <p>Recommendation is fundamentally a search problem - finding relevant data based on user input, be it text,
                like/dislike, personal profile, etc. Instead of searching for hours for interesting content, recommender
                systems automate the process based on minimal input and provide positive feedback (entertaining content)
                instantly.</p>

            <h2>Universal Application</h2>

            <p>Recommendation is universal across many apps, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Matching platforms</li>
                <li>Content consumption apps</li>
                <li>Social media</li>
                <li>Autocompletion</li>
                <li>Automation tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges in Recommender Systems</h2>

            <p>Recommender systems are not an easy problem to solve. Sites like Amazon, Taobao, and even adult content
                platforms struggle with this. The challenges include:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Obtaining the right datasets with sufficient scale (which takes time)</li>
                <li>Justifying the cost of compute with the value squeezed out from the algorithm and data</li>
                <li>Finding talents with robust experience for engineering mature and large-scale recommender systems
                </li>
            </ol>
