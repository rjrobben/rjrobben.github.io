        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a PCLL student + Machine Learning Engineer. I like to learn new things and I wish I am better at
            sharing interesting things
            to others. That's why I start this personal website + blog.
        </p>

            Currently approaching law as a data engineering problem.
            Struggling whether I should prioritise the convenience of taking notes freely over taking notes within a
            defined stringent data schema.
            And if data schema are to be defined, how should it be done.
            If I am following a set of schema, I need a custom interface for CRUDing my notes, which takes time to
            develop.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Tools in Consideration</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GraphDB or SQL?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Neo4j or NebulaDB?</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Haha, by now you already get a sense of what kind of persons I am: perfectionist suffering from millions of
            possible decisions at each step.</p>
        <p>I would like to reduce the entropy of my life. Let me know if you are able to attain a low entropy life!</p>
