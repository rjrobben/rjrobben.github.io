The most popular and successful apps like Instagram, YouTube, Threads, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Spotify all share a common feature: a powerful recommender system. All your feeds are arranged by recommendation algorithms operating on large-scale datasets behind the scenes.

Meta has even built a cluster of GPUs specifically for recommending personalized content to users. (Source: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-cmMcMZoZ4))

Recommendation is fundamentally a search problem - finding relevant data based on user input, be it text, like/dislike, personal profile, etc. Instead of searching for hours for interesting content, recommender systems automate the process based on minimal input and provide positive feedback (entertaining content) instantly.

Recommendation is universal across many apps, including:

-   Matching platforms
-   Content consumption apps
-   Social media
-   Autocompletion
-   Automation tools

Recommender systems are not an easy problem to solve. Sites like Amazon, Taobao, and even adult content platforms struggle with it. The challenges include:

1.  Obtaining the right datasets with sufficient scale (which takes time)
2.  Justifying the cost of compute with the value squeezed out from the algorithm and data
3.  Finding talents with robust experience for engineering mature and large-scale recommender systems

If you're interested in learning and building recommender systems, let's form a study group!
