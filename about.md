# About me

I am a software engineer, specialising in machine learning and AI, with background in law. I like to learn new things and I wish I am better at sharing interesting things to others. That's why I start this personal website + blog.

Currently developing a legal research platform that aims to provide high-quality legal information to legal practitioners and law learners.

It's going to be a big corp llm wrapper at the moment, because currently I do not have the gpu resources nor enough dataset to work on the weight level.

But hey, Cursor and Perplexity AI are also gpt wrappers! I hope I can bring tool of similar utility to the hand of legal practitioners in HK.

**Things I use**

-   whoop, a wrist band which tracks my sleep.
-   clojure, a programming language that i like because of the REPL interactivity.
-   SilverBullet, a offline-ready minimalist text editor and notepad.
-   VS Code, for vibe coding.
-   nvim, for programming.
