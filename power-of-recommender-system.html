Published @ August 15, 2024 at 11:46 PM HKT</p><p>The most popular and successful apps like Instagram, YouTube, Threads, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Spotify all share a common feature: a powerful recommender system. All your feeds are arranged by recommendation algorithms operating on large-scale datasets behind the scenes.</p><p>Meta has even built a cluster of GPUs specifically for recommending personalized content to users. (Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-cmMcMZoZ4" title="">YouTube video</a>)</p><p>Recommendation is fundamentally a search problem - finding relevant data based on user input, be it text, like/dislike, personal profile, etc. Instead of searching for hours for interesting content, recommender systems automate the process based on minimal input and provide positive feedback (entertaining content) instantly.</p><p>Recommendation is universal across many apps, including:</p><ul><li>Matching platforms</li><li>Content consumption apps</li><li>Social media</li><li>Autocompletion</li><li>Automation tools</li></ul><p>Recommender systems are not an easy problem to solve. Sites like Amazon, Taobao, and even adult content platforms struggle with it. The challenges include:</p><ol start="1"><li>Obtaining the right datasets with sufficient scale (which takes time)</li><li>Justifying the cost of compute with the value squeezed out from the algorithm and data</li><li>Finding talents with robust experience for engineering mature and large-scale recommender systems</li></ol><p>If you're interested in learning and building recommender systems, let's form a study group!</p></article><script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.1.0/highlight.min.js">//</script><script>
