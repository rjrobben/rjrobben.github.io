I want one where switching to other apps outside of your chosen apps is extremely hard. And, with a super clear quest system as a default interface, like those in a game.</p><p>For example, I have 4 projects in the quest system. Clicking into one of them will show all the tasks I defined before. And I can click the task I want to focus in this session, and add all the apps I need:</p><ul><li>VScode</li><li>browser with access only to certain documentation websites that I will need</li></ul><p>Then, I click do quest, and i can’t go outside these apps until the session time’s up.</p><p>The consequence of being distracted?</p><ul><li>you can’t sustain attention on something until rewards are ready</li><li>affect your hormone → bad mood</li><li>makes you stick to the screen → affect your eyes, neck and waist and spine → your health.</li><li>lower your awareness and make you more vulnerable to being distracted.</li><li>a vicious cycle.</li><li>your life will be miserable.</li></ul><p>Start with activity that might have exponential / compounding effect on your life, albeit difficult to start at first:</p><ul><li>exercise (I picked yoga as it can be done solo without much external dependencies)</li><li>writing</li><li>solving problems</li><li>meditation</li><li>drawing</li></ul><p>You wanna spend each day in flow state or in muddy social media distracted state?</p><p>It’s time to change.</p></article><script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.1.0/highlight.min.js">//</script><script>
