<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>One of the most powerful conceptual frameworks in computer science is the use of graphs, which can be used to model everything from protein structures to social networks and even the human body. Additionally, concepts such as recursion and divide and conquer are very general strategies that resemble those in the Art of War. Studying all these has made me feel like I have gained several iq points. Using them after learning how to encode real world problems into numbers is a lot of fun.</p><p>In contrast, I have found that studying law can sometimes make me feel like I am dumber, as the subject matter can be quite specific and difficult to grasp. If law is about the methodologies to design a legal system that maximizes a society&rsquo;s justice function and the systematic evaluation of such a system, it might be a different story.</p><h2 id=skills-with-people-vs-skills-with-systems>Skills with people vs skills with systems
<a class=heading-link href=#skills-with-people-vs-skills-with-systems><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Ok, perhaps the gems of law are not the subject matter but the experience in dealing with people, <em>the people skills</em>: ability to negotiate, convince and argue. As you gain more experience, you will be better at human engineering, and that might be the real value of legal experience.</p><p>While the ability to deal with people and navigate the hierarchy of a society is one of the most important skills to survive decently in society, I am more drawn to building systems that are used by a large number of people and appreciate the real contributors of the infrastructure behind many of the systems we use today.</p><p>A bad metaphor is playing a game of Grand Theft Auto or a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The experience of completing missions and minigames to increase your rank is certainly fun, but I find it even more enjoyable to explore the open world and discover hidden gems.</p><h2 id=the-excitement-of-applied-problem-solving>The Excitement of Applied Problem Solving

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s during my undergraduate part-time job that I started programming for the first time. I used to spend a lot of time doing report summaries for my boss by copying and pasting information from several websites. It&rsquo;s boring and frustratin to click and drag with the mouse repeatedly.</p><p>I tried to google for a better ways to complete such repetitive task, and the only reasonable solution that I have found was web scraping. I then started my journey of solving real world problems with programming. It&rsquo;s not that I was able to make a beautiful script that performs exactly what I wanted to do, but it feels like the right thing for my brain to work on and my career to be based.</p><p>Of course, with web scraping and today&rsquo;s LLM capabilities, the whole task could be completely automatable.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>All in all, while a law degree can provide valuable people skills, I have found that my passions lie in the exciting world of computer science. By utilizing my skills in programming and AI, hopefully I can build systems that are used by many people and contribute to solving complex problems in our world.</p></article></section><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script>
