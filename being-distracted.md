# Being Distracted

I just realize I am always being distracted.

The computer and the phone are two powerful distracting machines.

The friction to perform a new exciting task is so small (just through a cmd-tab / ctrl-t) that I am constantly distracted from the task I am doing.

The consequence of being distracted?
- you can’t sustain attention on something until rewards are ready
- affect your hormone → bad mood
- makes you stick to the screen → affect your eyes, neck and waist and spine → your health.
- lower your awareness and make you more vulnerable to being distracted.
- a vicious cycle.
- your life will be miserable.

Start with activity that might have exponential / compounding effect on your life, albeit difficult to start at first:
- exercise (I picked yoga as it can be done solo without much external dependencies) 
- writing
- solving problems
- meditation
- drawing


You wanna spend each day in flow state or in muddy social media distracted state? 

It’s time to change.
