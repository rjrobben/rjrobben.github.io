# Being Distracted
September 23, 2025 at 22:41:25 HKT

I just realize I am always being distracted.

The computer and the phone are two powerful distracting machines.

The friction to perform a new exciting task is so small (just cmd-tab / cmd-t) that I am constantly distracted from the task I am doing.

I don’t understand why all major OS and browsers are designed like this. To stay focus, switching to other apps should be extremely hard. 

Think a game. Can you quit easily and perform other tasks? No. Instead, you have a super clean quest system, inventory system ..etc. And, they are simply slider or drawer that you can quickly show and hide them. They are not intended to capture your attention. 

The OS that I imagine looks like something as follow:
I have 4 projects in the quest system. Clicking into one of them will show all the tasks I defined. I can click the task I want to focus on, and add all the apps I need, e.g.:
- VScode
- browser with access only to certain documentation websites that I will need

Then, I click “do quest”, and i can’t go outside these apps until the session’s time’s up.

Why?

Because the consequence of being distracted is not worth it.
- you can’t sustain attention on something until rewards pay off
- affect your hormone → bad mood
- makes you stick to the screen → strain on your eyes, neck and waist and spine → negative impact on your health and energy level.
- lower your awareness and you are more vulnerable to being distracted.
- a vicious cycle.
- your life will be miserable.

You wanna spend each day in flow state or in muddy-social-media- distracted state? 

Pick activity that requires flow-state and might have exponential / compounding positive effect on your life, albeit difficult to start at first:
- exercise (I picked yoga as it can be done solo without much external dependencies) 
- writing
- solving problems
- meditation
- drawing
 
It’s time to change.
